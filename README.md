# vertical-video-hider
Fight the tiktokification of the internet by hiding all vertical videos in your browser. For Chrome and Edge.

To use:
1. Save the folder
2.Go to the Extensions page:
- Chrome: chrome://extensions
- Edge: edge://extensions

3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click "Load Unpacked"
5. Select the folder
6. Congrats.

You can disable / enable.
Note that this will not disable the audio. It will just stop the video.
The video may be resized to a skinny bar, or it may remain full-size (a bug I can't be bothered to work on).

Save your brain from the rot! Don't voluntarily ingest vertical video slop!
This extension will only save you from accidentally consuming garbage on sites that have no business showing vertical videos (you know who you are).
If you willingly go to youtube / tiktok IO cannot help you*.

*Actually I kind of do need to work out a destroyer for YT Shorts so if anyone can help pls ping me
